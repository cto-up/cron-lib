# Fail if this library's goose migrations would be unsafe in a consumer app.
#
# Consumer apps flatten THIS library's migrations together with their own module
# migrations and every other cto-up library into ONE goose namespace (see the
# consumer's RunGlobalMigrations / NewMapFS). A duplicate version_id there makes
# goose either panic at startup ("duplicate version") or, worse, treat the losing
# migration as already applied and SILENTLY SKIP it — the schema change never
# lands and the first failing query reports a missing column or relation.
#
# Numbering scheme (adopted 2026-08-13, after coreapp v0.2.29 collided with a
# skeells module migration on version 20260810120000):
#
#   new migrations : 16 digits = YYYYMMDDHHMMSS + 2-digit SOURCE ID
#                    01 core-be-lib  02 cron-lib  03 outbox-lib  04 lcgo-lib
#   consumer apps  : bare 14-digit YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
#
# A 16-digit version is ~100x larger than any 14-digit one, so a library version
# can never equal an app version, and the source ID keeps the libraries apart
# from each other. No cross-repo coordination is needed at release time.
#
# Existing 14-digit files here predate the scheme and are grandfathered by
# LEGACY_MAX. Anything NEWER than that must use the 16-digit form.
